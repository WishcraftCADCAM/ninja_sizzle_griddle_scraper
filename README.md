This is a 3D-printable griddle scraper for a Ninja Sizzle griddle.  The "teeth" in the comb are the same size and dimensions as the default grooves in the griddle surface.  Makes clean up a breeze!

I would humbly suggest that a food-safe or food-grade filament be used, although since you will presumably be washing your griddle surface, it probably doesn't matter very much.

Includes the OpenSCAD file for anyone who wants to read/modify it.
